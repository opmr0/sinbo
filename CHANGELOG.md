## 1.2.1 - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Description field to snippet metadata

### Fixed
- Suppressed false-positive `RUSTSEC-2026-0097` advisory for `rand 0.8.5` (unsoundness does not affect sinbo's usage)

### CI
- Added `cargo audit` check to the pipeline

## 1.2.0 - 2026-04-10

### Added

- `sinbo encrypt <name>` — encrypt an existing plaintext snippet
- `sinbo decrypt <name>` — permanently decrypt an encrypted snippet

### Changed

- Bumped Argon2id memory cost from 19MB to 32MB and time cost from 2 to 3

## 1.2.0-beta - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Snippet encryption** — `sinbo add <name> --encrypt` prompts for a password and stores the snippet as an encrypted `.enc` file. `sinbo get` detects encrypted snippets automatically and prompts for the password.
- Encrypted snippets are listed normally with a `Locked` indicator. `sinbo list --show` displays `[encrypted]` instead of the content.
- `sinbo search` skips the content of encrypted snippets — only the name is matched.
- `sinbo remove` now correctly deletes `.enc` files alongside metadata.

### Changed

- `storage::exists()` now checks for both `.code` and `.enc` files — previously encrypted snippets were invisible to duplicate checks.
- `sinbo edit` on an encrypted snippet now returns a clear error instead of silently operating on empty content.
- Editor undo corruption: if the editor is closed without saving, or the resulting content is identical to what was written initially (e.g. full undo in vim), sinbo now detects the unchanged state and aborts instead of saving empty or garbage content.
- `storage::save_meta()` extracted as a public method for use by encrypted add.
- `storage::Snippet` now carries an `encrypted: bool` field.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-04-01

### Added
